### 3. Set the New Edition and Enter Product Key

Replace `YOURPRODUCTKEY` with your actual product key:

```bash
dism /online /set-edition:serverstandard /productkey:YOURPRODUCTKEY /accepteula
```

- Make sure the edition (`serverstandard`) matches one of the target editions listed earlier.
- Use the correct syntax: `/accepteula` must be included.

## Notes
