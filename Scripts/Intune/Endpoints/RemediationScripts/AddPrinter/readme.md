✅ Key Requirements to Avoid Authentication When Adding a Printer
Domain Environment:

Both the print server and client machines should be joined to the same Active Directory domain.
Proper Permissions:

The printer must have permissions set to allow the user (or a group they belong to) to connect and print.
You can configure this in the printer's Security tab in its properties.
Group Policy Configuration:

Use Group Policy to deploy printers automatically or make them available without requiring manual authentication.
Navigate to:
User Configuration > Preferences > Control Panel Settings > Printers
You can deploy shared printers here.
Print Server Authentication Settings:

Ensure that Point and Print Restrictions are configured correctly:
Go to gpedit.msc on the client machine or configure via Group Policy:
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Printers > Point and Print Restrictions
Set "Users can only point and print to machines in their forest" to Disabled or configure trusted servers.
Set "Do not show warning or elevation prompt" to Enabled.
Driver Installation:

If the driver is already installed on the client, adding the printer won’t prompt for elevation or authentication.
You can pre-stage drivers on clients or use Group Policy to install them silently.
Firewall and Network Access:

Ensure that the client can reach the print server over the network without restrictions.
🛠️ Optional: Use Intune (since you manage devices with it)
If you're using Intune, you can deploy printers using Intune Device Configuration Profiles or PowerShell scripts to automate printer installation without user interaction.

Would you like help setting up a Group Policy or Intune profile for this? Or do you want to troubleshoot a specific printer that's prompting for authentication?




To deploy a printer via Intune without requiring user authentication, you can use Intune Device Configuration Profiles with PowerShell scripts or Universal Print (if you're using Azure AD and cloud printers). Here's how to do it using a PowerShell script, which works well for traditional on-prem print servers:

🛠️ Steps to Deploy a Printer via Intune Without Prompting for Authentication
1. Prepare the PowerShell Script
Here’s a sample script to add a shared printer from a Windows print server:




PowerShell
$printerPath = "\\PrintServerName\PrinterShareName"
$printerName = "Your Printer Name"

# Check if printer already exists
if (-not (Get-Printer -Name $printerName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Add-Printer -ConnectionName $printerPath
}

Replace:

PrintServerName with your actual print server name.
PrinterShareName with the shared name of the printer.
Your Printer Name with a friendly name for the printer.
2. Create a Device Configuration Profile in Intune
Go to Microsoft Intune Admin Center.
Navigate to Devices > Windows > Configuration Profiles.
Click + Create Profile.
Choose:
Platform: Windows 10 and later
Profile type: Custom
3. Add the PowerShell Script
Alternatively, go to Devices > Scripts > Add.
Choose PowerShell.
Upload your .ps1 file.
Configure the script to run in the System context (not user context) to avoid authentication prompts.
Set "Run script as 64-bit process" to Yes if needed.
4. Assign the Profile
Assign the script to the appropriate device groups.
Once deployed, the printer should be added silently without requiring user authentication, assuming the device has access to the print server and the user has permission.
✅ Tips to Ensure No Authentication Prompt
Make sure the print server is accessible from the client device.
Ensure the printer share has Everyone or Domain Users with Print permissions.
Use system context in Intune so it runs with elevated privileges.
Pre-stage drivers if needed to avoid elevation prompts.
Would you like me to generate the .ps1 file for you or help with Universal Print setup if you're using Azure AD?

# Pre-Staging Drivers
Pre-staging printer drivers on Windows devices (especially in an Intune-managed environment) helps avoid elevation prompts and authentication issues when users connect to shared printers. Here's how you can do it:

🛠️ Method 1: Use PowerShell to Pre-Stage Drivers
You can use a PowerShell script to install the printer driver silently before the printer is added. This works well with Intune.

Example Script to Pre-Stage a Driver

```Powershell
# Define the relative path to the INF file inside the package
$infPath = ".\DriverFiles\YourPrinterDriver.inf"

# Install the driver silently
pnputil /add-driver $infPath /install

Write-Output "Current Directory: $(Get-Location)"
```

Replace C:\Drivers\YourPrinterDriver.inf with the actual path to your .inf driver file.
You can package the driver files and script together in a .intunewin file using the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool.
🧰 Method 2: Use Intune Win32 App Deployment
Download the printer driver package from the manufacturer.
Extract the .inf, .cat, and related files.
Create a folder structure like:
C:\IntunePrinterDriver\
├── InstallDriver.ps1
└── DriverFiles\
    └── YourPrinterDriver.inf
Use the Win32 Content Prep Tool to package it:



Shell
IntuneWinAppUtil.exe -c C:\IntunePrinterDriver -s InstallDriver.ps1 -o C:\Output

Upload the .intunewin file to Intune as a Win32 app.
Set the install command to:



PowerShell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\InstallDriver.ps1

Assign to device groups.
✅ Why This Works
Installing the driver in system context avoids elevation prompts.
Once the driver is present, adding the printer via script or manually won’t require authentication or admin rights.


# Installing Mobility Print
🧰 Step-by-Step: Deploy PaperCut Mobility Print via Intune
✅ 1. Download the Mobility Print Installer
Go to the PaperCut Mobility Print download page and download the Windows client installer (.exe).
✅ 2. Create a Silent Install Script
Create a PowerShell script (InstallMobilityPrint.ps1) to silently install the client:

PowerShell
```Powershell
Start-Process -FilePath "MobilityPrintClientSetup.exe" -ArgumentList "/S" -Wait
```

The /S switch performs a silent install.

✅ 3. Package with Intune Win32 Content Prep Tool
Place both the .exe and .ps1 in a folder:

C:\MobilityPrintDeploy\
├── MobilityPrintClientSetup.exe
└── InstallMobilityPrint.ps1
Use the Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool to package it:

```Powershell
IntuneWinAppUtil.exe -c C:\MobilityPrintDeploy -s InstallMobilityPrint.ps1 -o C:\Output
```

✅ 4. Upload to Intune
Go to Intune Admin Center > Apps > Windows > Add.
Choose Win32 app.
Upload the .intunewin file.
Set install command:

```Powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\InstallMobilityPrint.ps1
```

Set uninstall command if needed (optional).
Assign to device groups.
✅ 5. Configure Mobility Print Server
Ensure your Mobility Print server is configured with the correct printers and access policies.
Enable Google, Microsoft, or Azure AD SSO if you want seamless authentication.
🧪 Optional: Test Before Broad Deployment
Test on a few devices to ensure:

The client installs silently.
Printers appear automatically.
No authentication prompts occur (if SSO is configured).
